# Stars Coding Challenge 1: Haskell Campus Map

You can find demo videos, further reading, and solution code at this [activity page on the ESIIL Learning Portal](https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/esiil-learning-portal/pages/03-git-github/03-github-portfolio/map-stars.html)

To use:

  1. Click on `Use this Template` in the upper right, and select `Open in Codespace`. This might take a minute if you haven't done it in awhile.
  2. Once the Codespace loads, open `first-map.ipynb`
  3. Complete the activity
  4. Find your map in the left-hand file explorer, click on the `...` and download your map.
  5. [Stop your Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace#stopping-a-codespace) so you don't use up your allocation!
